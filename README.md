# Call_Graph
Call graph is a graph that visualizes calls between functions within a code. After parsing the code using Rex and Yak, the data structure stores the contents related to function calls (Ex. which function calls which function, how many times it calls, and what line of code it calls, etc.). Then, write a program that outputs in the form of a call graph.
